# Student Name: Wanyue Xiao
# Homework Number: Week 8
# Date: 10/13/2020

# Sttribution statement:
# 1. I did this homework by myself, with help from the book and the professor.

# 1.
data("HairEyeColor")
HEcombined <- HairEyeColor[ , ,1] + HairEyeColor[ , ,2]
sum(HEcombined)
# the total number of students is 592.

# 2.
HEcombined/sum(HEcombined)
# the difference between orginial Hecombined table and this table is the scale. Instead of 
# showing the exact number of student, the table shows the proportion of student in the population.
# the totality of columns or rows should be equal to 1.
# no, i cannot.

# 3.
chiOut <- chisq.test(HEcombined)
chiOut
# output:
#  data:  HEcombined
#  X-squared = 138.29, df = 9, p-value < 2.2e-16
# The p-value is less than 0.05, indicating that null hypothesis of independence between
# Hair and Eye will be rejected. The two variablesa are not independent.
# To calculate the number of degrees of freedom of a contigency table, 
# the equation is (4-1)*(4-1)=9.

# it is important that we can get the 95% HDI range of each four combinations. take the 
# brown:black as en example. the mean of lambda[1,1] is similar to that of brown:black. 
# checking the hdi range, we could also get the 95% hdi of brown:black, which is from 52.526 
# to 84.72.

# we create a list of 10,000 posterior results, each one calculated as a ratio of the Black:Brown cell 
# count to the Black:Blue cell count for one element in the posterior distribution. then to visualize the
# list, we can get a right-skewed histogram. The mean of firstRowRatio is 3.46, indicating that
# the count for the brown cell was as 3.5 times as higher as the count for the blue cell.
# Similarly, we can get histogram of secondRowRatio.

mean(diff) # Hereâ€™s the center of the distribution
# the HDI does not overlap with zero. there is credible evidence that in the population there is an association between 
# those two variables.
