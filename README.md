## 1. Paper: How I Would Learn Data Science
Paper-link
A paper summarises knowledge and techqniues learned in the master's program.

## 2. [Professional Resume](./wanyuex.pdf)
The resume is updated on March 2021.

## 3. Academic Projects
A) **IST 719**: Information Visualization <br>
Covered Skills: Data cleaning techniques, Control of the R graphics environment, Develop custom plots, Visually explore data, Use design concepts to visually communicate the story in the data, and Discuss issues related to the ethics of data visualization Knowledge <br>
<br>
The deliverables of IST719 are a poster and an advanced topic presentation. For the poster design, which is the [Video Game Analysis](./IST719/719_game_poster.pdf), I have chosen the "Video Game" dataset obtained from Kaggle and generated a Cyberpunk style poster using R and Adobe illustrator. For the advanced topic presentation, I have chosen [Information Visualization in Kaggle](./IST719/719_advanced_topic_ppt.pptx) as a topic and shot a short video with professional slides. <br>

<br>

B) **IST 769**: Advanced Big Data Management <br>
Covered Skills: Relational SQL (Programming, Transactions, Concurrency Control, Performance, Security), Hadoop Ecosystems (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Hbase, Impala, etc), noSQL (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Kakfa, KSQL, Graph Databases), Data Modeling & Design <br>
<br>
The final project of IST769 is to provide a detailed and professional presentation based on the chosen topic. The topic I have chosen is the introduction of a graph database named [Neo4j](./IST769/xwanyue_whitpaper_Neo4j.pdf). <br>
<br>

C) **IST 664**: Natural Language Processing <br>
Covered Skills: Statistical Parsing, Semantic Processing & Representation, Role Labeling, Discourse Analysis, Coreference Resolution, Deep NLP (Word Embedding, CNN) <br>
<br>
IST664 is designed to help students develop techniques of unstructured text processing, including concepts regarding text analysis and the ability to generate a linguistic analytic report. The coursework project was to establish models for [Detection of Personal Experiences or Storytelling](./IST 664/Final Project/NLP Final Project Report.docx) based on a database annotated by Professor Lu Xiao and her research team. Besides, our group also researched the aspect of [Deep Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging](./IST 664/Final Project/664_poster.pdf).
<br>
<br>
D) **IST 700**: Deep Learning, NLP, and Computational Social Science <br>
Covered Skills: Principles of data mining methods, including Algorithmic Bias, Model Evaluation Beyond Accuracy, Corpus Annotation, and theories of text mining, including BERT in sklearn and Word embedding (word2vec and GloVe) <br>
The course of IST700 aims to introduce prevalent data mining methods for extracting knowledge from data. For the final project, our group generated a [COVID-19 Public Sentiment Analysis research](./IST700/Final Project/700_final_project.pdf) paper to capture popular topics and associated sentiment dynamics based on the massive social media posts on Twitter.<br>
<br>
E) **IST 707**: Data Analytics <br>
Covered Skills: Python, R, ML Models (Association Rules Mining, Classification & Clustering, Elementary Deep Learning, Evaluation & Analysis) <br>
IST 707 covers various data mining methods for data analysis, ranging from . As a code intensive course, IST707 requires student to obtain hands-on experience tby solving real-world problems with state-of-the-art data mining solutions. In the final project, our group used Association Rule Mining, Logistic Regression and several Classification approaches, such as Decision Tree, Support V ector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) etc. to analyze the [U.S. Car Accidents dataset](./IST707/Final Project/IST707 Final Project Report.pdf) <br>
**Poster:** <br>
