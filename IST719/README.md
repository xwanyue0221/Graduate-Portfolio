# IST 719: Information Visualization 
The learning objective of IST 719 is developing a portfolio of resources, demonstrations, recipes, and examples of various data visualization techniques. 

## Project Description
The final project is to create a poster for a self-chosen database, using R and Adobe illustrator. Personally, I chose the ["Video Game Sales"](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) dataset obtained from Kaggle
